  description: "Excuse me, traveler. Please, help me out.  \n\nTime is of the essence.
    A hunting party raided a nearby village not too long ago and they're probably
    hiding in the nearby hills. We need to deal with them now before they either
    attack again or grow in force. It's time to bring justice to those nasty humans.
    If you don't mind, I'd like to come along. It's your choice though. I don't think
    you'll have much troubles dealing with those humans. \n\nKill as many of them
    as you'd like, just make sure you don't forget your main goal.  I wish I had
    something better to reward you with, but what I have ain't too bad either. \n\nSafe
    journey, hero. We believe in you."
